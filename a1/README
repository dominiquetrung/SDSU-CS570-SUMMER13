Lessons Learned

This is a simple program that demonstrates processes, threads and semaphores. 
The program will create a semaphore for a file called PROCTAB.txt and create
10 threads to write to it every second. The semaphore helps to mitigate problems
that arise with parallelism such as race conditions.

To build and run, type 'make run'. 


a1.h -- header
a1.c -- main source
makefile -- makefile
PROCTAB.txt -- output file

To build and run: 
make run

The output is printed to stderr and also PROCTAB.txt

Lessons Learned:
Learned a lot about semaphores and the intricacies of threading.
